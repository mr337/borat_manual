Introduction
==============
The Baker Observatory Robotic Autonomous Telescope (BORAT) is one in a hand full
of robotic telescopes in the United States that is fully autonomous or 
hopes to be. The system is built with a server running Linux as an 
operating system and telescope control system called RTS2. This system,
once setup, should run the telescope fully autonomously. 

This document serves as a *how-to* for various things. It will include
how the main systems work and their inner parts. How to do things like
maintenance and recovery. How inner systems are laid out and simple protocols.
With a little luck, it will also include a crash guide.
